# Lost & Found App - Project Overview

## 1. Introduction
The Lost & Found App is a web-based application designed for university students to report lost or found items. The system facilitates item retrieval by allowing users to post details and images of lost/found objects while matching reports based on categories and location. Complex functionalities, such as semantic matching, will be optional or replaced with simpler approaches like categorization.

## 2. Target Audience
- **University students** who need to report lost or found items.
- **Administrators** responsible for moderating content and ensuring platform safety (optional, only if mandatory features have been implemented).

## 3. Key Features

### Mandatory Features:
- **User Authentication** (University email-based login, password reset).
- **Lost & Found Item Posting** (Category: Student ID card, money, books, etc.), description, images, location, etc.
- **Item Search & Filtering** (By category or date range; optionally by location such as department, etc.).
- **Personal Space** to view published reports.
- **User Notifications** (When someone replies to a published Lost & Found Item Post or for new chat messages and conversations).
- **Chat System** (For arranging item returns; basic text exchange only, with optional comment functionality on posts).

### Optional Features:
- **Content Moderation** (Filtering user posts: deciding which should be published and which are irrelevant and should not be published).
- **Basic Matching System** (Category & location-based suggestions, e.g., if a lost item post matches a found item post, the user receives a notification).
- **Advanced Matching** (Semantic analysis or image recognition).
- **Banning Users** (Admins can ban users who repeatedly post inappropriate or fraudulent content, which can be reported).

## 4. Deliverables

### User Flow

#### 1. User Authentication:
- Users sign up/log in using their university email and other relevant information.

#### 2. Dashboard Access:
- Users view recent lost/found posts.
- Search bar and filtering options (category, date, location).

#### 3. Posting an Item:
- Users select “Lost Item” or “Found Item.”
- Provide details (category, description, date, location).
- Upload an image (optional but encouraged).
- Submit (won't get published until approved by moderators, optionally, only if the admin side is implemented).

#### 4. Moderation (Admin Side) *(optional)*:
- If not included, posts will be published automatically without verification.

#### 5. Item Matching & Notifications *(optional)*:
- Users receive alerts if a found item matches their lost item (category & location-based matching).
- Users can contact the poster via an in-app chat system.

#### 6. Retrieval Process:
- Users arrange pickup through chat.
- Optionally, users can mark an item as “Resolved.”

## 5. Specific Requirements

### UI/UX Requirements:
- Minimalist and easy-to-use interface.
- Mobile responsiveness.
- Consistent theme with campus branding.
- Clear call-to-action buttons (report, search, chat).
- Accessibility features (color contrast, text resizing).

### Stack Technologies Proposition:
*(You can use any technologies, but here are some recommendations:)*
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript *(React or Vue recommended).*
- **Back-end:** PHP *(Laravel)* or Node.js *(Express.js).*
- **Database:** MySQL or PostgreSQL *(structured to handle items, users, reports).*
- **Security:** Basic input validation.

## 6. Constraints *(Optional - Depending on the Project)*
- Limited access for non-university users to ensure only students use the platform.
- Storage constraints for uploaded images (maximum file size limit).
- Moderation delays if the admin review system is implemented.
- Chat system limited to text only (no images or file attachments).

## 7. Conclusion
The Lost & Found App for Campus will provide students with an easy way to retrieve lost belongings while ensuring a safe and moderated environment. With a focus on usability, efficiency, and basic moderation, the project remains within an easy-to-medium difficulty range, making it feasible for beginner developers while allowing room for optional complexity if desired.

This document serves as a structured guideline for development, ensuring clarity in the project scope, required features, and implementation roadmap.
